# Soil-Mapping-NPK
Mapping of soil's NPK nutrients content using NodeMCU and TCS3200 color sensor module to identify the concentration of N(Nitrogen) P(Phosphorous) K(Potassium) base on the color of the soil. The information, percentage of each soil contents, can be accessed via a website listing its content from when the monitoring originally started up until current/latest recordings/monitored values of soil's NPK.
